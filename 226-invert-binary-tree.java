     * at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.

     * Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst
     * case, where h is the height of the tree. Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).

     * Iterative approach
     *
     * Alternatively, we can solve the problem iteratively, in a manner similar to
     * breadth-first search.
     *
     * Algorithm
     * The idea is that we need to swap the left and right child of all nodes in
     * the tree. So we create a queue to store nodes whose left and right child have
     * not been swapped yet. Initially, only the root is in the queue. As long as
     * the queue is not empty, remove the next node from the queue, swap its children,
     * and add the children to the queue. Null nodes are not added to the queue.
     * Eventually, the queue will be empty and all the children swapped, and we return
     * the original root.
