  Problem:
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:
    n = 10, I pick 8.

    First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
    Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
    Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

    Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
    You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

  Given any [i,j], we make a guess x:
  [i, ..., j] = [i, ..., x, ..., j]
  Your strategy is the best, but your luck is the worst.
  Vx = x + max(dp(i, x-1), dp(x+1, j))

  dp(i,j) = min(Vi, V(i+1), ... Vx ... V(j-1), Vj)

  A second thought, Vj is not needed at all:
  if dp(i,j) = Vj 
  then Vj is the smallest of (Vi, V(i+1), ... Vx ... V(j-1), Vj)
       Also Vj = j + dp(i, j-1) = j + V(j-1)
       which means
       Vj > V(j-1) 
       That is to say Vj is not the smallest
  Conclusion:
    dp(i,j) != Vj
        

  Example: 
      n=5


     0   1   2   3   4   5           len = 2->3->4->5

 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |     i=1        i = 1->2->...->(n-len+1)
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+       v
 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |       2          j = len+i-1

 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |       3
   +---+---+---+---+---+---+       v

  Only need to fill the cell marked from 1 to 4
 
  len=2, fill the value for cell marked with 1
  len=3, fill the value for cell marked with 2
  len=4, fill the value for cell marked with 3
  len=5, fill the value for cell marked with 4
